# a tuple is similar to a list. the difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once
# it is assigned whereas, in list elements can be changed.

# tuples can be created placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses (), separated by commas.

# A tuples can have any number of items and the may be  different types (integer,float,list,sting etc.).
