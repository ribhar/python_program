# A set is an unordered collection of items. Every element is unique (no duplication) and must be 
# immutable (which cannot be changed).

# A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces{},
# sperated by commas.
# You can also use built in function set() to create sets.

# sets of integers
myset = {1,3,5}
print(myset)

# set of mixed datatypes
myset = {1,2.3,"hello",(1,2,4)}
print(myset)
